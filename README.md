# IDEA EDU Course ...

Implemented in the Java <b>Backend Developer</b> Track of hyperskill.org's JetBrain Academy.<br>
https://hyperskill.org/projects/217

Project goal (or rather my interpretation of it) is to implement a reactive Spring webflux application with functional endpoints
using Basic Auth Spring security eventually on HTTPS-protocol. 
The application will represent a simple account service with user authentication, different authorization roles
and some business logic endpoints accessing employee payroll data in a database.

Purpose of doing this project, is further practising Spring boot and security applications - experimenting with the reactive 
Spring webflux using functional Spring 5 routing/handler techniques. Also, with this project the Java Backend Developer track
should be completed, as only 1 or 2 applied topics are still missing to fulfill the 95% hurdle :-)
